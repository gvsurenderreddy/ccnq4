[CCNQ4](http://ccnq.shimaore.net)
=================================

SIP SoftSwitch. The development has started, see:
* [tough-rate](https://github.com/shimaore/tough-rate/), the new LCR engine (currently in beta)
* [well-groomed-feast](https://github.com/shimaore/well-groomed-feast), the new voicemail server (current under development)
* [acoustic-line](https://github.com/shimaore/acoustic-line), a CoffeeScript templating system to generate FreeSwitch XML configurations
* [docker.freeswitch](https://github.com/shimaore/docker.freeswitch), [docker.couchdb](https://github.com/shimaore/docker.couchdb), etc. -- ccnq4 will rely on docker.io instead of Debian packages which were the norm for ccnq3
* [abstracted-birds](https://github.com/shimaore/abstracted-birds) offers some ideas to build a UI for ccnq4
