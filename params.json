{"name":"Ccnq4","tagline":"","body":"[CCNQ4](http://ccnq.shimaore.net)\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nSIP SoftSwitch. All core development is completed (including Voicemail), development is now focusing on extended applications (IP Centrex).\r\n\r\nInfrastructure\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* [docker.freeswitch](https://github.com/shimaore/docker.freeswitch), [docker.couchdb](https://github.com/shimaore/docker.couchdb), etc. -- CCNQ4 relies on docker.io instead of Debian packages which were the norm for CCNQ3.\r\n* [ccnq4-opensips](https://github.com/shimaore/ccnq4-opensips), OpenSIPS-as-Docker-image integrated with configuration, CouchDB interfaces, REST management, ... (includes [royal-thing](https://github.com/shimaore/royal-thing), a tool to automatically restart an OpenSIPS registrant server on changes).\r\n* [willing-toothbrush](https://github.com/shimaore/willing-toothbrush), the CouchDB-backed DNS server.\r\n* [spicy-action](https://github.com/shimaore/spicy-action) is a web and Socket.IO proxy to allow browser-side clients, back-ends, and CouchDB, to exchange data.\r\n* [nifty-ground](https://github.com/shimaore/nifty-ground), the distributed sniffer, integrated with `spicy-action`, delivered as a Docker.IO container.\r\n* [ethereal-banana](https://github.com/shimaore/ethereal-banana) and [absurd-clover](https://github.com/shimaore/absurd-clover), browser-side tools to handle sniffer traces and CDR statistics.\r\n* [proud-thumb](https://github.com/shimaore/proud-thumb), demonstration browser tool showing call progress in real-time.\r\n* [nimble-direction](https://github.com/shimaore/nimble-direction), distributed CouchDB toolbox -- used to ensure individual call-processing servers continue working even in case of failure or unreachability of the master-master, main provisioning database.\r\n* [cuddly](https://github.com/shimaore/cuddly), an operations-driven, simple to use and deploy, Socket.IO-based notification framework.\r\n\r\nFreeSwitch XML Configuration\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n* [acoustic-line](https://github.com/shimaore/acoustic-line), the CoffeeScript templating system to generate FreeSwitch XML configurations.\r\n* [bumpy-lawyer](https://github.com/shimaore/bumpy-lawyer) FreeSwitch phrases for pronunciation of numbers, spelling words, etc.\r\n\r\nFreeSwitch interaction with Node.js\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n* [esl](https://github.com/shimaore/esl), the Node.js Promise-based interface to FreeSwitch's event socket (inbound and outbound).\r\n\r\nCall Processing using Middleware\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nCCNQ4 uses the concept of middleware (similar to the ones used by Connect, ExpressJS, ...) to simplify writing dynamic call-handling applications.\r\n\r\n* [useful-wind](https://github.com/shimaore/useful-wind), a middleware-based framework to build applications for FreeSwitch.\r\n* [thinkable-ducks](https://github.com/shimaore/thinkable-ducks), a npm package and Docker.IO image extending `useful-wind` with a REST interface and Socket.IO event notifications (to the `spicy-action` proxy) and embeds FreeSwitch.\r\n\r\nAvailable middlewares / applications:\r\n\r\n* [tough-rate](https://github.com/shimaore/tough-rate/), LCR engine; provided as a [Docker image](https://gtihub.com/shimaore/docker.tough-rate) with FreeSwitch, a REST interface and Socket.IO notifications. Also available is [its munin plugin](https://github.com/shimaore/earsplitting-food).\r\n* [huge-play](https://github.com/shimaore/huge-play), the base SBC middleware for CCNQ4.\r\n* [well-groomed-feast](https://github.com/shimaore/well-groomed-feast), the CouchDB-backed voicemail.\r\n* [brown-pencil](https://github.com/shimaore/brown-pencil) the French \"RIO fixe\" interactive voice service (under development).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
