CCNQ4 =
- Docker.io instead of Debian packages
  - docker package per app e.g. freeswitch, opensips, etc.
  - docker package per node.js app (but need to keep config alongside e.g. FreeSwitch, so will need _changes-based + RabbitMQ there still) -- yes, but as clients, not servers
- node.js clustering for better throughput (esp. ESL clustering)
- programmable LCR w/ ESL (remove outbound-proxies)
- keep (LCR) vs (Billing info) separate
- fully-tested & benchmarked ESL, copes with crashes, load, etc.
- CDRs with proper IDs & dynamic (e.g. per month, per day, per account + day, etc.) DB-names
- routing data out of provisioning db; one routing DB per routing profile; summarize `rules` (digit patterns) into `routes` (e.g. "SP.mobile") for provisioning purposes (bulk edits, basically)
- conntrack etc. for mediaproxy failover
- more _changes monitors
- freeswitch reload_acl etc
- RabbitMQ automation (using `rabbitmq-management` plugin and its [API](http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-management/raw-file/rabbitmq_v3_3_5/priv/www/api/index.html))
- proper RabbitMQ <-> browser integration (e.g. Socket.IO, sock.js, etc.)
- recent (>=1.4) FreeSwitch
- logs!! (winston, winston-irc, winston-amqp, winston-nodemailer)
- metrics!!
- IPv6
- use CouchDB `_replicator` instead of our own (i.e. make it a provisioning operation, not a local, runtime operation)
- since we're using Docker, all accesses must be (a) authenticated and (b) encrypted. Use Node.js' tls.connect() and tls.CreateServer()'s `ca` option to that goal (and provide / copy a toolbox for CA management) -- ideally automate that as well during Docker image creation.
- provide proper certificates to CouchDB, RabbitMQ, OpenSIPS, and FreeSwitch
- use JSON interface for OpenSIPS (the one I wrote!)
